# Predicting Passenger Satisfaction: How On-Time Performance Shapes Airline Customer Loyalty

Story:
Punctuality is one of the most critical factors influencing airline customer satisfaction. In aviation, a flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within 15 minutes of its scheduled time. Airlines closely track On-Time Performance (OTP), but how much does it actually impact passenger satisfaction and loyalty?

This project explores how different factors—especially OTP—shape customer feedback and satisfaction levels. Using data analytics and machine learning, I:

Identified key factors that influence whether a passenger leaves a ‘satisfied’ or ‘dissatisfied’ review.
Applied predictive models to determine the strongest drivers of positive feedback.
Documented the entire process, from data analysis to machine learning, providing actionable insights for airlines to improve customer experience.
The final insights offer a data-driven approach for airlines to enhance operational efficiency and customer retention, ensuring passengers have more satisfying travel experiences.
